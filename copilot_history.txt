// Generate a minimal C++ "Hello World" program

I'll create a small todo plan, add the C++ source and README, then compile and run the program to verify it prints "Hello, World!". I'll start by writing the todo list.

Created 3 todos

Now I'll create the C++ source file and README in the repository. Expected outcome: src/main.cpp and README.md created.

Created main.cpp
Created README.md

Progress update: I created main.cpp and README.md. Next I'll try to compile and run the program in a terminal to verify output. I'll run g++ to compile and then run the executable.
