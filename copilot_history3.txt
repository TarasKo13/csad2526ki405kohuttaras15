// Using the Google Test framework, write a simple unit test.
// Include "gtest/gtest.h" and "../math_operations.h".
// Create a test suite named "MathTests".
// Create a test case named "BasicAdditionTest".
// Inside the test, assert that the add(2, 3) function call equals 5.

Copilot: 

I'll add two more Google Test cases to unit_tests.cpp: one for negative numbers and one for zero. Expected outcome:
file updated with three tests total and todo updated.

Created 7 todos

I'll update unit_tests.cpp to include two more test cases: one for negatives and one for zero. Expected outcome: file contains three tests.

Read unit_tests.cpp

I'll write three Google Test cases (basic, negatives, zero) into unit_tests.cpp and add a test main so the tests can be run standalone. 
Expected outcome: unit_tests.cpp contains three TESTs and a main that runs them.

I'll re-read the current file to ensure exact context before applying the update.

Read unit_tests.cpp

Since the file is empty, I'll overwrite it with the new test content.

unit_tests.cpp +22-1
Completed (7/7) Add gtest unit test

Done — I added three unit tests and a test main to unit_tests.cpp:

MathTests.BasicAdditionTest -> expects add(2,3) == 5
MathTests.NegativeNumbersTest -> expects add(-2,-3) == -5
MathTests.ZeroTest -> expects add(0,0) == 0
Notes and next steps

Your editor shows include-path errors because gtest/gtest.h isn't available in the current include paths. To run tests you'll need Google Test installed and CMake configured to find it.
I can:
Update CMakeLists.txt to add a test target that uses FetchContent to download and build Google Test automatically (recommended).
Or give step-by-step PowerShell commands to build the test manually if you already have gtest installed.
Which would you like me to do?

User: перезапусти збірку тут з генератором Visual Studio

Copilot: I'll mark the "Compile and run" todo as in-progress, then run CMake using the Visual Studio generator (configure + build Release). 
Expected outcome: CMake config and a successful MSVC build or a clear error if Visual Studio generator isn't available. 
I'll run the commands in PowerShell at the repo root.

Starting (2/7) Compile and run

I'll run CMake configure and build with the Visual Studio generator from PowerShell to generate a VS solution and build it. 
Expected outcome: either successful build or clear errors.

I'll run CMake configure and build correctly using the Visual Studio 2022 generator (fixing the previous typo), 
then attempt to run the built executable from the usual output locations; outcome should be a generated VS solution, 
built Release target, and (if present) execution of hello.exe.

I'll mark the compile task as still in-progress and note it's blocked because CMake couldn't find Visual Studio; 
then I'll explain the error and give PowerShell commands to retry after you install or select another generator.

I tried to re-run the build with the Visual Studio generator but CMake failed: "could not find any instance of Visual Studio." That means the machine where the terminal runs doesn't have Visual Studio (MSVC) installed or CMake can't detect it.

What's happened so far

I ran: mkdir build; cd build; cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..; cmake --build . --config Release
CMake returned: "Generator Visual Studio 17 2022 could not find any instance of Visual Studio."
Why this happened

The Visual Studio generator requires a matching Visual Studio installation (e.g., Visual Studio 2022) with the C++ workload. 
If Visual Studio isn't installed or the Developer Command Prompt environment isn't set up, CMake can't use that generator.
Options to resolve (pick one)

Install Visual Studio 2022 (or the version you want) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload. After installing, 
re-run the same CMake commands in a fresh PowerShell session.

Use an alternative generator already available:

If you have MSBuild/Visual Studio but different version, pick the matching generator string (e.g., "Visual Studio 16 2019").
If you have MinGW-w64/g++, use the Ninja or MinGW Makefiles generator and build with g++. Example (requires mingw on PATH):

3. If you want, I can update CMakeLists.txt to add a test target for Google Test (using FetchContent) now, 
but building tests will still require a working generator/toolchain.

User: 

3. yes, i want

Copilot:

I'll update CMakeLists.txt to add FetchContent-based GoogleTest integration and a test target that builds unit_tests.cpp 
and links math_operations.cpp. Expected outcome: CMake will download GoogleTest and provide a unit_tests target and ctest integration. 
I'll update the todo list accordingly.

Read CMakeLists.txt

I'll patch CMakeLists.txt to add FetchContent for GoogleTest, create a unit_tests executable from unit_tests.cpp and math_operations.cpp, 
and enable testing. Then I'll update the todo.

CMakeLists.txt +22-0
Updated todo list

I'll reconfigure the project to download/build Google Test and add a unit_tests CMake target.

What I changed

Updated CMakeLists.txt to:
Use FetchContent to download GoogleTest (release-1.12.1).
Add an executable target unit_tests built from unit_tests.cpp and math_operations.cpp.
Link gtest_main and register the test with CTest.
Next step — build with Visual Studio generator

You previously asked to use the Visual Studio generator. On this machine CMake couldn't find Visual Studio. 
After you install Visual Studio (with Desktop C++ workload) or if it's already installed but not detected, 
re-run these commands in PowerShell from the repository root:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
ctest -C Release --output-on-failure

If Visual Studio isn't available and you'd rather use MinGW or Ninja, here are alternative commands:

MinGW (if g++ is in PATH and MinGW Makefiles generator is available):

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
.\unit_tests.exe

Ninja:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
cmake --build .
.\unit_tests.exe

User:

MinGW

Copilot:

I'll check whether g++/MinGW is available, then configure and build with the MinGW Makefiles generator and run the unit tests if the build succeeds. 
Expected outcome: either tests run or a clear message explaining what's missing.

Updated todo list

I'll check if g++ is on PATH and then run CMake with MinGW Makefiles. If MinGW isn't present, I'll report back.

g++ is available. I'll run CMake configure with MinGW Makefiles and then build and run unit_tests.exe.

Fetching and building GoogleTest can take some time; I'll wait for the build to finish and then run the tests.

Checked background terminal output

I'll re-run the build command to capture full output and run tests, since previous run may still be in progress or output truncated.

It looks like the initial CMake configure step succeeded earlier (FetchContent running). 
But the Makefiles weren't generated in this directory, perhaps because the initial run didn't finish. 
I'll run a fresh configure and build again in the build directory.

I'll inspect src/main.cpp and the top-level CMake output to confirm file paths. I'll read src/main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt.

It looks like earlier I created src/main.cpp but perhaps the path is different — 
I previously created it at c:\Users\Taras\csad2526ki405kohuttaras15\src\main.cpp. Let's list the repository to confirm.

I'll update CMakeLists.txt to use the existing main.cpp at the repository root (instead of main.cpp), 
then reconfigure and build with the MinGW generator and run the unit tests. Expected outcome: successful configure/build 
and running of unit_tests.exe.

CMakeLists.txt +1-1
I'll run configure + build again with MinGW Makefiles now that paths are corrected.

GoogleTest is being built; I'll wait for the build to finish and then run the tests.

Checked background terminal output

I'll run the build command again to completion and then execute unit_tests.exe when available.


Build and tests succeeded using MinGW — summary and next steps:

What I ran

Verified g++ is available (g++ 14.2.0).
Configured and built with the MinGW Makefiles generator:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
CMake used FetchContent to download GoogleTest and built unit_tests.
Ran the unit tests:
Test output (successful)

[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (10 ms total)
[ PASSED ] 3 tests.
Files touched

CMakeLists.txt — added FetchContent GoogleTest + unit_tests target
math_operations.h, math_operations.cpp, unit_tests.cpp — already present and used.
Next suggestions

If you want a clean developer workflow, add a short section to README.md showing how to run tests with CMake/MinGW and Visual Studio examples 
(I can update it).
If you plan to use Visual Studio on other machines, we can retain the MinGW-friendly CMake changes (they're cross-generator).
I can also add a .gitignore entry for build artifacts if needed.
Would you like me to:

Update README.md with exact build/test commands?
Add a helper PowerShell script (e.g., scripts\build_and_test.ps1) to automate these steps?


User:

Update this CMakeLists.txt file to add support for unit testing with Google Test.
Use the FetchContent module to get Google Test.
Enable testing with CTest.
Create a library named "math_lib" from math_operations.cpp.
Link this library to the main executable "hello".
Add the "tests" subdirectory. In that subdirectory, create a test executable named "run_tests" from unit_tests.cpp.
Link the "run_tests" executable against the "math_lib" library and Google Test (gtest_main).

Copilot: 

I'll read the current CMakeLists.txt to ensure it matches your requested structure; if it doesn't, 
I'll update it to create math_lib, link it to hello, add FetchContent for GoogleTest, enable CTest, 
and add tests subdirectory with run_tests. I'll update the todo list accordingly.

Read CMakeLists.txt

I'll read CMakeLists.txt to confirm it matches the requested test target layout before editing the top-level file.

I'll list top-level and tests directory files to confirm current state, then replace the top-level CMakeLists.txt with a clean, 
single CMake script and (re)create CMakeLists.txt if missing. Expected outcome: valid CMakeLists.txt and CMakeLists.txt matching your requirements.

I'll replace the top-level CMakeLists.txt with a clean implementation and (re)create CMakeLists.txt so the project matches your requested layout: 
math_lib, hello, FetchContent GoogleTest, CTest, and run_tests linking math_lib + gtest_main.

It looks like the apply_patch returned empty which can happen if the files were unchanged. I'll read the top-level CMakeLists.txt 
now to confirm its content.

Read CMakeLists.txt

I'll replace the top-level CMakeLists.txt with a clean, single CMake script (removing duplicated and fenced content) and ensure CMakeLists.txt 
exists and matches the requested layout. I'll apply a direct patch to overwrite the top-level file and create/update the tests CMake file.

CMakeLists.txt+13-16
The CMakeLists.txt is missing; I'll create it now.

CMakeLists.txt
Updated todo list

Done — I updated the project to use Google Test with FetchContent and organized the build as you requested.
