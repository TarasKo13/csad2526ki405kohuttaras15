Batch script for Windows CI: create and enter a new 'build' directory, run 'cmake ..' for configuration, 
run 'cmake --build .' for building, and finally run 'ctest --output-on-failure'. 
Ensure the script checks for errors after each major command.

Copilot:

I'll add a todo entry for creating the CI batch script, write the ci.bat file with error checks after each step, 
then mark the todo completed. I'll start by adding the todo as in-progress.

Added 1 todo

I'll create ci.bat at the repository root with proper PowerShell/cmd style commands for Windows batch, 
checking exit codes after each step and exiting on failure. Expected outcome: ci.bat added.

I added a Windows CI batch script ci.bat that creates a fresh build directory, runs CMake configure, 
builds the project, and runs tests with error checks after each major step.

What I added

ci.bat at repository root with these behaviors:
Removes any existing build directory.
Creates build and enters it.
Runs cmake .. and fails fast if configure fails.
Runs cmake --build . and fails fast if the build fails.
Runs ctest --output-on-failure and fails if any tests fail.
Prints clear [CI] and [CI][ERROR] messages for each step.
Quick look — ci.bat contents (summary)

Remove old build if present
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. (error check)
cmake --build . (error check)
ctest --output-on-failure (error check)
How to run

From PowerShell or CMD at the repository root run:
In CMD:
ci.bat
In PowerShell:
ci.bat
Notes and follow-ups

The script uses the default CMake generator. If you want it to use a specific generator (MinGW, Ninja, or Visual Studio), I can add an optional environment variable or a parameter to the script to select the generator and configuration (Release/Debug).
I can also add logging to a file or make the script more robust (detect available generators, set CMake flags, or run with parallel jobs).
I updated the todo list marking this task completed.
Want me to:

User: 

Shell script that runs CI: clean existing build directory, create and enter a new 'build' directory, 
run 'cmake ..' for configuration, run 'cmake --build .' for building, and finally run 'ctest --output-on-failure'. 
The script must exit immediately if any command fails.

Copilot:

I'll add a todo for creating a shell CI script, then create ci.sh at the repository root containing 
an error-strict bash script that cleans, configures, builds and runs tests. Finally I'll mark the todo complete.

Added 1 todo

I'll create ci.sh at the repository root with strict bash flags, perform cleanup, run cmake and build, 
then ctest. I'll ensure it's portable (works on Linux/macOS/WSL) and exits on any error.


Completed (9/9) Add CI shell script

Done — I added a simple CI shell script ci.sh that runs the requested steps and exits if any command fails.

What I created

ci.sh at the repository root:
Uses strict bash flags: set -euo pipefail
Removes any existing build directory
Creates and enters build
Runs cmake .. to configure
Runs cmake --build . to build
Runs ctest --output-on-failure to run tests
Prints status messages and exits immediately on any failure
How to use

On Linux, macOS, or WSL:

Make it executable once: chmod +x ci.sh
Run: ci.sh
On Windows with WSL or Git Bash you can also run ci.sh.

Notes and next steps

The script uses CMake's default generator. If you need to force a generator (MinGW, Ninja, Visual Studio), 
I can add optional environment variables or command-line flags.
I can also add logging to a file, a verbose mode, or a CMD/PowerShell wrapper that calls ci.sh from Windows.
