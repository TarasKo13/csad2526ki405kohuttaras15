Generate a basic CMakeLists.txt for a C++
Copilot:
I'll update the todo list, read the current CMakeLists.txt, then replace it with a minimal CMake setup so the project builds src/main.cpp. 
Expected outcome: CMakeLists.txt updated to a small CMake project that builds hello. I'll update the todo states as I go.

Completed (1/4) Create source files

Now I'll read the existing CMakeLists.txt to edit it appropriately. Expected outcome: get current contents to modify.

Read CMakeLists.txt

I'm going to add a minimal CMakeLists.txt that builds src/main.cpp as an executable; expected outcome: 
CMakeLists.txt contains a simple CMake project targeting C++17 and an hello executable. I'll apply the change now.

CMakeLists.txt +14-1

Progress update: I added CMakeLists.txt. Next I'll mark the todo item completed and provide build/run instructions.

Completed (4/4) Create CMakeLists

I'll add a minimal CMake setup and give you build/run instructions next.

Actions taken
Created src/main.cpp with a minimal Hello World program.
Created README.md with build/run instructions.
Added a minimal CMakeLists.txt that builds src/main.cpp as an executable named hello.

Files changed:

src/main.cpp — minimal Hello World source
README.md — build and run instructions
CMakeLists.txt — simple CMake project (C++17) building hello
